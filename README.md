# Laptop-Price-Prediction-for-SmartTech-Co.

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting laptop prices for SmartTech Co. based on various features such as brand, specifications, and technical details. The project leverages supervised learning algorithms to create a predictive model that can estimate the price of a laptop based on its attributes.

**Key Features**:

**Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the laptop dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize numerical features for optimal model performance.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze and visualize relationships between different features such as brand, processor type, RAM, storage, and price.

**Feature Engineering**: Extract and create new features from existing data to improve model accuracy.

**Model Training**: Implement multiple machine learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict laptop prices.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate models using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to determine the best-performing model.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model performance using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters.
Deployment: Provide a prototype of the price prediction system, which can be integrated into SmartTech Co.â€™s website or application.
Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Machine Learning Algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
Jupyter Notebook (for code and analysis)
